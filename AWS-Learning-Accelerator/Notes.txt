Cloudtopia passport office.

What do I think should be used?

- s3 for image storage
- idk for compute and facial recognition
- RDS for database
- SNS for notifications
- AWS api?

The correct options are:

- image storage: s3
- Compute, API: AWS Fargate (services) (itâ€™s great for managing APIs), AWS Lambda (lambda suffers from something called cold starts) (has direct integrations with other AWS services),
- Facial Recognition: Amazon rekognition. (has confidence bands, integration with other services, etc)
- Database: Amazon DynamoDB (horizontally scalable)
- Notifications: (Amazon SNS; what we would need)
- API: (amazon API Gateway)
