# AWS Lambda Mastery Course - Personal Study Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal study guide for mastering AWS Lambda! As a student and the founder of "JaniePets," a veterinary startup aimed at simplifying the lives of pet owners, I am embarking on this learning journey to enhance our recall alert app. My goal is to acquire hands-on skills in AWS Lambda, which I will then translate into Terraform `.hcl` code to align with best practices.

### Course Overview

This course, taught by an industry veteran with over 10 years of experience, differs from others by its practical approach. As someone who has followed the instructor's guidance on the "Be a Better Dev" YouTube channel, I am excited to delve into the practical aspects of building and running Lambda-based applications at scale. The course promises to impart fundamental concepts, behind-the-scenes workings, deployment strategies, and advanced topics like concurrency, monitoring, and service integration. 

### Why This Course?

- **Practical Focus:** Unlike other courses that dwell on theory, this one provides actionable insights from real-world applications.
- **Expertise:** The instructor brings a decade of industry experience in building Lambda applications, ranging from small microservices to large-scale event processing systems.
- **Hands-On Learning:** The course offers the opportunity to build and debug Lambda applications, along with learning advanced concepts through practical projects.

### Projects Outline

During this course, I aim to complete three practical projects to solidify my understanding and apply it to my startup:

1. **Build a Rest API with API Gateway:** This project will involve creating a RESTful API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, an essential skill for backend development.

2. **Cloudwatch Events with Lambda:** This project will focus on integrating AWS Lambda with Cloudwatch for event-driven applications, a critical aspect for monitoring and automation.

3. **Event Processing with SQS:** The final project will entail developing a system for processing events using AWS Lambda and SQS (Simple Queue Service), providing insights into handling high-volume data streams.

### Applying Learning to JaniePets

The skills and knowledge gained from this course will be directly applied to JaniePets. The aim is to enhance our recall alert app, making it more robust, scalable, and efficient. By leveraging AWS Lambda and the best practices learned, I intend to create a more responsive and reliable service for our pet owner community.

## Conclusion

I am excited to start this journey and eager to see how these new skills will propel JaniePets forward. As I progress through the course, I will update this README with insights, challenges, and achievements. Let's make pet care easier and more efficient with the power of AWS Lambda!
