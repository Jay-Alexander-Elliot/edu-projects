        <p>About Jay-Alexander Elliot

Hello! Iâ€™m Jay-Alexander Elliot. My professional background is in IT, but recently I've ventured into the realm of notary services, apostille, fingerprinting, and background checking with my company, Mobile Legal Solutions. This shift was a pragmatic choice during a challenging phase in the tech industry.

Mission Statement

At Mobile Legal Solutions, we specialize in notary, apostille, fingerprinting, and background checking services for people and businesses in Contra Costa County. Our goal is to support individuals with physical disabilities, offering mobile services for hassle-free document processing.

Company Story

After the tech layoffs in early 2023, I found myself navigating a saturated job market as a DevOps engineer. This situation led me to establish Mobile Legal Solutions as an interim venture while I plan my return to the tech industry.

Side Gig

The services provided by Mobile Legal Solutions are a practical side endeavor. It runs alongside my primary focus on JaniePets, a veterinary startup fueled by my entrepreneurial drive and dedication to animal welfare.

Who We Serve

Mobile Legal Solutions serves Californians, prioritizing accessibility for the physically disabled. Our mobile services are tailored for anyone needing notary, apostille, or fingerprinting services, ensuring convenience and reliability.

Professional Approach

With a career spanning roles at companies like picoEdge, my IT background has equipped me with skills in precision and efficiency. These attributes now underpin my commitment to delivering dependable and professional services through Mobile Legal Solutions.</p>
